"""What an object at distance r looks like to an observer at the same depth.

The model is the standard single-scattering form for a horizontal path::

    L(r) = L_target * exp(-c*r) + B_inf * (1 - exp(-c*r))

The first term is exact given c. The second is not something this package can
supply: the veiling radiance B_inf depends on the backscattering coefficient
and on the shape of the phase function, neither of which is determined by the
Jerlov classification (DATA.md section 10). The caller provides it.

`veiling_radiance_estimate` offers the usual single-scattering estimate for
callers who have nothing better, but it must be called deliberately and it
still needs a backscattering ratio.

Deliberate limitations, recorded in DECISIONS.md section 13:

- **Horizontal paths only.** Observer and target are at the same depth, so
  the downwelling irradiance is a single spectrum. A slanted path would need
  integration along a changing depth.
- **No forward-scatter blur.** This gives the radiance of one point, not the
  sharpness of an image. Blur needs the full phase function.
- **Lambertian targets.**
