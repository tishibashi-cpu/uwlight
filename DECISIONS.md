# Design decisions

Why this package is shaped the way it is, and what was considered and
rejected. `DATA.md` records what is known about the data; this file records
what was decided about the code.

Entries are append-only. If a decision is reversed, add a new entry saying so
rather than editing the old one.

---

## 1. The source is part of the API

`jerlov.water("III")` alone would be a lie. The same Jerlov type has
different coefficients in different papers, and at 510 nm the scattering
coefficients of Solonenko & Mobley and of Williamson & Hollins differ by a
factor of 2.6. A function that returns one number for "Jerlov III" hides a
choice that changes the answer.

So `source` is an argument, `Water` carries the `Source` it came from, and
`Water.caveats()` reports what is doubtful about it.

**Rejected:** picking the best source and hiding the rest. That is what the
literature already does implicitly, and it is why two groups can publish
incompatible tables under the same names without anyone noticing.

## 2. The equations' constants belong to the source, not to the equations

Both papers use the scattering model of Haltrin (1999), but Solonenko &
Mobley print and compute with a small-particle coefficient of 1.513 where
Haltrin gives 1.151302. Reproducing their table needs 1.513; using the model
correctly needs 1.151302.

A single module-level constant would therefore be wrong for one of them.
`ScatteringConstants` is attached to each `Source`.

**Rejected:** correcting Solonenko & Mobley to 1.151302. Their published
tables were computed with 1.513, and silently changing it would mean the
package could no longer reproduce the paper it claims to ship.

## 3. Williamson & Hollins is the default source

It is the only published set in which a and b rest on measurement rather than
on inverting Kd. `Source.measured` records the distinction so a caller can
check rather than take our word for it.

The cost is coverage: it has six water types, not ten. That is the honest
trade. Jerlov I, IA, 7C and 9C are absent because too few measurements exist,
and inventing them would defeat the point.

## 4. `bb` has no default

The backscattering coefficient is not determined by the Jerlov
classification. Deriving it from the two sources' particle concentrations
gives answers differing by up to a factor of 31, and neither is inside the
range reported in the literature (DATA.md section 10).

`Water.bb` therefore raises unless `backscatter_ratio` is passed. The
docstring gives the ranges so the caller can choose, and refuses values
outside (0, 0.5).

**Rejected:** a default of 0.0183, the Petzold average-particle value. It
would be defensible and would be wrong for most water, and nobody would ever
see it. Making the caller state it is the only way the choice stays visible.

**Rejected:** deriving bb ourselves from the World-wide Ocean Optics
Database, which holds 1,200 bb profiles that nobody appears to have used for
this. That is a paper's worth of work and out of scope; it is recorded in
DATA.md section 10 so that someone can do it.

## 5. No extrapolation

Asking for a wavelength outside the data raises `ValueError`. A silently
extrapolated value is indistinguishable from a measured one at the point of
use, and the caller has no way to find out afterwards.

`kd_spectrum` applies the same rule to the Austin & Petzold model range.

## 6. Gaps stay gaps

Where a published value is wrong and could not be recovered, the value is
`nan` and interpolation across it yields `nan`. `numpy.interp` will happily
bridge a gap if the NaN is not in the sampled interval, so `Water._interp`
checks the bracketing samples explicitly.

**Rejected:** filling by interpolation, as Williamson & Hollins did in their
spreadsheet for the absorption values they could not recover. Their choice is
reasonable for their purpose and is carried in the
`williamson2022_value_per_m` column, but a package cannot make it on the
caller's behalf.

## 7. Reconstruction used the source's own constant

The `b` values reconstructed for the duplicated rows of Solonenko & Mobley
Table 7 were computed with their 1.513, not Haltrin's 1.151302, because the
purpose is to fill a hole in *their* table. For Jerlov 5C this agrees with
the Williamson & Hollins substitution to three decimal places, which is
evidence that both parties made the same choice independently.

A test fixes this: `test_solonenko_reconstruction_used_its_own_constant`
asserts the values match 1.513 and do **not** match 1.151302.

## 8. Warnings, not silence and not errors

Interpolating across a value that a paper got wrong produces a number that
looks no different from a sound one. Raising would make the package unusable
for exploratory work; saying nothing would make it dangerous.

`ProvenanceWarning` is emitted when a returned value rests on a wavelength
flagged `suspect`, `missing`, `extrapolated`, `reconstructed` or
`model_extrapolation`. Callers who do not want them can filter them; the
point is that the information exists.

## 9. Named water types are only an entry point

`water("III")` builds a `Water` from arrays and returns it. Everything
downstream works on the arrays. `Water.from_measurements` produces an object
of exactly the same kind.

This is deliberate. Solonenko & Mobley's own code path — a function per water
type — is how `UWOpticalSystemsDesignTools` ended up with three of its eight
profiles wrong: a bug in one branch is invisible from the others. One code
path means a defect shows up everywhere or nowhere.

## 10. NumPy only

`jkibele/OpticalRS` has been broken since 2019 because scikit-learn moved a
module. Nobody noticed for seven years because nothing was watching.

Runtime dependencies are NumPy alone. Interpolation is `numpy.interp`; CSV
reading is the standard library. `openpyxl` is needed only by `tools/`,
`matplotlib` only by the optional `plot` extra. CI runs weekly as well as on
push, so a break is noticed even when nobody has touched the code.

## 11. Tables live in the package; the scripts that made them do not

`jerlov/data/` is the single copy of every CSV. `tools/` holds the scripts
that produce them from the primary sources, and `sources/` holds the inputs
and is not tracked.

Running the scripts must reproduce the shipped CSVs byte for byte. This is not
decoration: a drift was found this way, when a fix applied directly to a CSV
had not been applied to the script that generates it.

## 12. Scope

In:

- Inherent optical properties of the Jerlov water types, with provenance
- Conversions between them, where a published relation exists
- Enough of the light field to answer "what does an object at distance r,
  seen by an observer at depth z, look like" (planned; see below)

Out:

- Solving the radiative transfer equation. That is HydroLight's job.
- Remote sensing reflectance, the view from above the surface. HYDROPT and
  OpticalRS occupy that ground.
- Shortwave heating for ocean circulation models, where the Jerlov type is an
  integer index and no spectrum is involved.
- Machine-learning image restoration.
- Deriving new coefficients from primary observations.

## 13. The path model, and what was left out of it

`Scene.observe` implements the single-scattering form for a horizontal path:

```
L(r) = L_target * exp(-c*r) + B_inf * (1 - exp(-c*r))
```

The direct term is exact given c. `Scene.transmittance` exposes `exp(-c*r)`
on its own, because that is the part with no approximation in it.

**B_inf is a required argument.** The usual estimate is
`bb * Ed / (2 pi c)`, but the `2 pi` assumes the backscattered light is spread
uniformly over the backward hemisphere, which real phase functions are not.
Since bb is already undetermined (section 4), a default here would be a guess
resting on a guess. `veiling_radiance_estimate` provides the formula for
callers with nothing better, but they have to reach for it.

**Horizontal paths only.** Observer and target at the same depth, so one
downwelling spectrum suffices. A slanted path needs integration along a
changing depth, and the extra machinery would not buy accuracy the rest of
the model can support. The main uses — a diver looking sideways, an ROV
looking at a structure — are horizontal.

**No forward-scatter blur.** Convolving a point spread function needs the
full phase function. With bb undetermined, the whole phase function certainly
is. The line is drawn at "the radiance of this point", not "the sharpness of
this image".

**Depth is recorded, not used.** With a horizontal path the depth enters only
through the downwelling irradiance. `Scene.at_depth` applies
`Ed(z) = Ed(0) exp(-Kd z)` and requires Kd to be supplied, because the default
IOP source does not carry it.

## 14. Colour needs a stated white, and coverage needs checking

`spectrum_to_srgb` requires `white`. A radiance spectrum has no colour on its
own, and underwater the reference that makes a grey card grey is the
downwelling irradiance at that depth, not daylight. Choosing one silently
would answer a question the caller did not ask.

The adaptation divides XYZ by the white's XYZ and rescales onto the sRGB
white point: a von Kries transform performed in XYZ rather than cone space.
It is cruder than CAT02 for strongly coloured illumination, which underwater
illumination certainly is. The docstring says so and calls the result "what a
white-balanced camera would record" rather than a prediction of appearance.

**Rejected:** normalising by luminance alone. It leaves a cast whenever the
white is not D65, which underwater it never is. This was implemented first
and was wrong; the tests now pin the behaviour for three different whites
including a deliberately blue-green one.

`CoverageWarning` exists because integrating a 450-650 nm spectrum against
colour matching functions that run from 360 to 830 nm gives a plausible
number that is simply wrong. The integral is reported over the overlap and
the caller is told what fraction that was.

The CIE 1931 observer and the D65 illuminant are shipped as data with the
same provenance treatment as everything else (DATA.md section 12). They were
transcribed rather than approximated: an analytic fit to the colour matching
functions would have been smaller, but it would have put numbers in the
package that came from nowhere in particular.

## 15. A declared minimum must be tested, not asserted

`pyproject.toml` says `numpy>=1.22`. Version 0.1.1 shipped using
`numpy.trapezoid`, which was added in NumPy 2.0. The package therefore did not
run on the versions it claimed to support, and the CI did not notice because
every job installed the newest NumPy available.

Two changes followed.

`jerlov/colour.py` resolves the name once at import:

```python
_trapezoid = getattr(np, "trapezoid", None) or np.trapz
```

`np.trapz` is the pre-2.0 name and was removed in 2.0, so neither can be
assumed.

The test matrix now includes a job pinned to the oldest declared NumPy. A
lower bound nobody tests is a guess, and this one was wrong for a whole
release.

**Rejected:** raising the floor to the version that happened to work. That
would fix the symptom by narrowing the claim, and would leave the next
lower-bound claim just as untested.

## 16. Coefficients that cannot be told apart still get names

`Scene.attenuation_coefficients` returns beta_D, beta_B and B_inf for the
Akkaynak-Treibitz image formation model. Under the single-scattering model in
section 13 both betas are the beam attenuation coefficient c, so on its own
this adds nothing that `Water.c` does not already give.

Three options were weighed.

**Return them, plainly equal.** Honest, but a caller sees two names for one
number and may reasonably conclude the package distinguishes them.

**Refuse to provide them.** Also defensible: naming quantities you cannot
separate suggests you can. Rejected because the need is real. Implementations
that fit these coefficients bound them by guesswork for want of any physical
starting point; one such fitting code bounds them with hard-coded sigmoid
ranges. Withholding c helps nobody.

**Return them with the limitation in the type.** Chosen. The result carries
`are_distinct = False` and a `note` saying why, so the limitation travels with
the value instead of living in documentation the caller may not read.

`distance_range_m` is a required argument even though single scattering does
not use it. Akkaynak & Treibitz's point is that these coefficients vary with
range, so a value quoted without its range is not a well-defined quantity.
Accepting the argument and recording it also means the signature does not have
to change if the model is ever refined.

A test rebuilds the Akkaynak-Treibitz expression from the returned
coefficients and requires it to match `Scene.observe` exactly, so the two
routes cannot drift apart.

## 17. Planned

Recorded so the shape of the API can be judged against where it is going.

- **Akkaynak-Treibitz coefficients**: beta_D, beta_B and B_inf for a stated
  distance range. The range must be an argument, not hidden, because those
  coefficients are not constants.
- **Depth profiles**: Williamson & Hollins (2023) give the Jerlov type at each
  10 m layer down to 200 m, so that a scene at 40 m in nominally type I water
  uses the type that actually applies there.

Validation is deliberately staged. The package can claim that it implements
published coefficients correctly, and the tests demonstrate that. It cannot
claim that it predicts what a camera will record underwater; that needs
measurements that have not been made. The README says so.
